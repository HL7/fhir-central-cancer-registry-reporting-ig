  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    The Making Electronic Data More Available for Research and Public Health (MedMorph) project seeks to advance public health and patient-centered outcomes by 
		using emerging health data and exchange standards, such as Health Level 7 (HL7<sup>®</sup>) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR<sup>®</sup>)
		and Clinical Quality Language (CQL), to develop and implement an interoperable solution enabling access to clinical data. More information
		about the MedMorph project can be found on the MedMorph Reference Architecture (RA) Implementation Guide (IG) homepage (INSERT LINK).
    </p>
    <p>
    The MedMorph Central Cancer Registry Reporting Content IG specifies how the MedMorph RA IG is leveraged to
    enable health care organizations to implement <a href="usecases.html">Central Cancer Reporting Use Cases</a>. This standard facilitates automated, 
	    standardized exchange of cancer surveillance data from ambulatory healthcare provider EHR systems to central cancer registries. The goal of 
	    this IG is to leverage existing technology frameworks and standards (e.g., minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE)), 
	    facilitate automated electronic collection and exchange, reduce reporting burden on data providers, augment secure transfers, and 
	    enhance data completeness, timeliness, and accuracy of cancer surveillance data using modern IT standards.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="usecases.html">Use Cases</a> - The use cases provide clinical context for this IG as well as information implementers should know before reading the remainder of the IG.  
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="spec.html">Detailed Specification</a> - The formal specification identifying the requirements for the implementers.
    </li>
