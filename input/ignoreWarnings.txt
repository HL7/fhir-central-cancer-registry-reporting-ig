# Expansion Parameters Related Error

No definition could be found for URL value 'http://hl7.org/fhir/tools/StructureDefinition/expansion-parameters'

# Cancer Specific Value Sets that tooling is unable to expand because they are too large, it is a limitation of the publisher.

The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed

# Messages due to specific versions of the IG

The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent appropriate version is 8.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered
The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 4.0.1 but package hl7.fhir.uv.subscriptions-backport.r4#1.1.0 is based on FHIR version 4.0.0. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try
This IG is version 4.0.1, while the IG 'hl7.fhir.uv.subscriptions-backport.r4' is from version 4.0.0

# Messages Due to Inherited Slicing

The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)
