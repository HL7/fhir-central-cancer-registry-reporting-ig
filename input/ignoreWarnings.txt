# Cancer Specific Value Sets that tooling is unable to expand because they are too large, it is a limitation of the publisher.
The value set include has too many codes to validate (4,919), so each individual code has not been checked
The value set include has too many codes to validate (1,492), so each individual code has not been checked
The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed

# Cannot change these because these value sets exist in the MedMorph IG and are reused by this IG.

# This is happening because the WG extension is automatically getting introduced by the publishing tool as an extension which does not conform with the base profile.
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/central-cancer-registry-reporting/StructureDefinition/ccrr-plandefinition|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
